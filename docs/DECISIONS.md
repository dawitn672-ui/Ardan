# Decisions

One short record per important design or engineering choice: what was chosen, what else was considered, and why.
Read before changing anything these touch. To reverse one, add a new record that says so; never edit an old one.

---

### D-001 · Repo layout: features live with their system (2026-11-11 23:43 ET, round 2 step 0)
**Chosen:** every feature folder moved from `features/NN-name/` to `src/<system>/NN-name/` (11 systems: core, map,
world, people, family, nobility, diplomacy, war, economy, events, ui). Features still apply in the order of their
folder names, sorted across all systems exactly as before, so the build is unchanged (verified: the new blobs differ
from the old only in comments). Every tool finds features through `tools/lib/features.mjs`, never by path.
**Considered:** keeping `features/` and adding `src/` only for new code (no navigation gain); renumbering features
per system (would change patch order and break 196 patches that depend on it).
**Why:** the owner asked for a layout split by system; ordering by name keeps the 196 order-dependent patches valid.

### D-002 · Events stay as code, next to their system (2026-11-11 23:43 ET)
**Chosen:** event packs (`*.events.js`) stay in their feature folders. `data/` holds only content that is pure data
(cultures and names, military branches, items), loaded as `A.DATA[...]` by the build.
**Considered:** moving all events to `data/events/` as JSON.
**Why:** an event holds functions (`cond`, `setup`, sometimes `text`, `fx`, check functions), and `A.evAudience` /
`A.CX_RX` classify events by reading those functions' source. JSON would lose them; moving the `.js` files away from
the feature that owns their flags and patches would split one unit of change across two places.

### D-003 · The v2 engine modules live in their systems (2026-11-11 23:43 ET)
**Chosen:** `src/v2/*.js` moved to `src/<system>/engine/` (body, races, odds, renown in people; kin, succession in
family; war, orders in war; ...), entry `src/core/engine/index.js`. The bundle is byte-identical apart from its path
comments. The kit's standalone demo UI went to `archive/v2-kit-demo-ui/` (never part of the game).
**Why:** split by system, as asked; the engine's unit tests (`tests/v2/`) still pass (29 of 29).

### D-004 · Measurement harnesses are tools (2026-11-11 23:43 ET)
**Chosen:** `bench/` moved to `tools/bench/`, its reports to `tools/bench/reports/`.
**Why:** the owner's layout puts build, playtest and check scripts under `tools/`.

### D-005 · Working branch and milestones (2026-11-11 23:43 ET)
**Chosen:** round 2 works on `v2-integration`, so PR #2 runs CI on every push. Milestones get a `release/<name>`
branch (beta.1 is `release/v2.0.0-beta.1`) as well as a row in `docs/VERSIONS.md`.
**Considered:** a new branch and pull request for round 2; git tags.
**Why:** the session's git proxy refuses tag pushes (tried again on Nov 12: the push is cut off), and a new PR would
need its own CI setup; release branches can be pushed and restored like tags.

### D-006 · Tests use the container's Playwright (2026-11-11 23:43 ET)
**Chosen:** `tests/run.mjs` falls back to `/opt/node-tools/node_modules/playwright` when `node_modules/playwright`
is missing; in a fresh container delete the pinned copy after `npm ci`.
**Why:** the pinned Playwright 1.56.1 wants a Chromium build the container does not have; CI installs its own.

### D-007 · Descriptions open on click (2026-11-11 23:43 ET, owner's round 2 order B4)
**Chosen:** hover pop-ups are removed; a button or an info icon opens a description. This replaces V2_SPEC's older
rule "never hide a description behind a click".
**Why:** the owner's order. To be done in step B4; recorded now so nobody re-adds hover tooltips meanwhile.
**Done in B4 (Nov 12), and where the order met the code:**
- A choice on an event card keeps its tap for the choice (playtest round 1: a tap on a choice chooses), so its odds open through
  an info glyph `ⓘ` kept inside the button (`UI.TT.sweepChoices`), not through the odds text. An activity tile opens a sheet.
  Every other anchor inside a row or card explains itself when pressed, and the rest of the row still acts.
- The roughly 150 descriptive `title=` sites (mostly in the release's minified code) are lifted at run time by `UI.TT.sweepTitles`
  (a text element becomes the trigger, a button gets an info button beside it); feature code writes `data-note="..."`. A short
  title (three words or fewer) stays. The time dock's own hints (Next month and the speeds) are `aria-description` only, since the
  dock is B6's. A disabled control's reason opens through an info button beside it.
- The maps' province cards and the battle field's unit names show on a press, not on a moving pointer.
- Test and lint: `src/ui/99998-click-open/test.mjs` (`clickNoHover`, `clickOpens`, `clickLint`, `clickActSheet`).

### D-008 · Time moves by Next month or Next year (2026-11-12 00:07 ET, owner's order)
**Chosen:** two buttons, Next month and Next year. A year runs month by month underneath and stops early when
something needs the player (a real decision, an illness, an exam, a call to war); quiet months pass as feed lines.
Next year is the main button in childhood; an adult chooses. Next day and Next week stay for campaigns.
**Replaces:** V2_SPEC complaint 8's "only Next month" and the game-ux-playtest-loop rule "one button moves time".
**Why:** the owner: "There's no need to go month by month as a child without a reason and there are times simming a
whole year is too much as an adult." To be built as B6 after the owner reviews the critique; the spec and the skill
are updated when it is built.

### D-009 · Which model does which part (2026-11-12 00:07 ET, owner's plan)
**Chosen:** the owner's table, for every agent and every session that works on round 2:

| Part | Model | Effort |
|---|---|---|
| Step 0: restructure, history files | Opus 5.5 | High |
| Step 1: harsh critique and work order | Fable (5.2 or the newest Fable available) | Max |
| A1: lag | Opus 5.5 | High |
| A2–A3: rank and title consistency, coherency checks | Opus 5.5 | High |
| B4–B5: click-to-open descriptions, declutter | Sonnet 5.5 | High |
| B6: Next month or Next year (added Nov 12; not in the owner's table: treated like B4–B5) | Sonnet 5.5 | High |
| C6: relationships (households, servants, guards) | Opus 5.5 | High |
| C7: names and cultures | Sonnet 5.5 | High |
| C8: character design | Fable to plan, then Opus 5.5 to build | High |
| D9: map detail | Opus 5.5 | High |
| D10: war only when deployed | Sonnet 5.5 | High |
| D11: military branches | Opus 5.5 | High |
| D12: war and command depth | Fable to design, then Opus 5.5 to build | High |
| Playtester agents | Sonnet 5.5 | Default |

**How:** work is delegated to agents with that model and effort; the orchestrating session integrates, tests and
records. The first critique round of Nov 12 ran on the session's own model (Opus) before this plan arrived: its
reports are kept as evidence, and Fable at max effort writes the critique and the work order from them and its own play.

### D-010 · Token efficiency first; model and effort at the session's discretion (2026-11-12 00:44 ET, owner's order)
**Chosen:** the owner gave full discretion over model and effort and asked for token efficiency "by any means
necessary" with the game's goals in mind. D-009's table stays as the default guide. Practice:
- **Match the model to the work:** Haiku for searches and mechanical edits, Sonnet for interface, data and
  playtesting, Opus for systems, Fable only for judgment that steers many steps (the critique's final merge, the C8
  and D12 designs). Max effort only for those judgments.
- **No duplicate rounds.** The critique's first round (Opus) is evidence; one Fable lead merges it (the two Fable lens
  critics already started finish; the other three lenses go straight to the lead).
- **Tight briefs:** point agents at files and evidence instead of pasting; cap report length; reuse scripts in
  `tools/` and earlier evidence; grep with context instead of reading big files or minified blobs.
- **Few, targeted test runs:** run the tests a change touches locally; one full CI run per finished step.
- **Don't overload the 4-core machine:** at most 3 browser-driving agents at once.
- Browser AI is allowed (owner, Nov 12). This session has web search and a web-reading agent (used for research and references, on a small model); no other browser-AI tool is connected.
**Why:** the owner's order; it also keeps the 5-hour usage window from stopping the work.

### D-011 · ~~Art register: detailed anime~~ (superseded by D-015, 2026-11-12 10:46 ET), a designer's hand, deep customisation (2026-11-12 06:49 ET, owner's answer to CRITIQUE decision 1)
**Chosen:** keep the anime look, but far more detailed, as if drawn by a real character designer: grown-up proportions,
real noses, age and scars that show, and many more options for hair, height, facial features and build.
**Why:** the owner's answer. Steers C8a (the plan) and C8b/C8c (the build).

### D-012 · The crown picks the Marshal; feudal armies (Marshal part superseded by D-017, 2026-11-12 10:46 ET; the feudal armies stand) (2026-11-12 06:49 ET, owner's answer to CRITIQUE decision 3)
**Chosen:** the king may make anyone Marshal of the army, over the generals' heads (with real command handed over and
their resentment). Armies are feudal: each noble holds troops in proportion to his rank; the crown has royal knights;
the elite orders are under the crown but recruit from the whole kingdom by prowess; a duchy's knights fight for the
kingdom in war but, forced to choose, side with their duchy. **Why:** the owner's answer. Steers A2, D11 and D12.

### D-013 · One language, many cultures (2026-11-12 06:49 ET, owner's answer to CRITIQUE decision 7)
**Chosen:** most countries speak the same English language, so most realms draw on one large pool of plain English
names; cultures differ in customs, dress, faith and ways. Only a few far or non-human peoples sound different.
**Replaces:** the earlier "names modelled on real-world cultures" order (OWNER_ORDERS rule 8, superseded) and the
24 separately-flavoured pools of `docs/research/c7-name-data.json` as the default. **Why:** the owner's answer. Steers C7.

### D-014 · The open critique decisions the owner left to the plan (map look superseded by D-016; X1, X5 and the year by D-018 and D-019, 2026-11-12 10:46 ET) (2026-11-12 06:49 ET)
**Chosen (the critique's recommendations, until the owner says otherwise):** map look (decision 2): keep the
satellite ground and lay roads, rivers and names over it as crisp lines; X1 (decision 4): turn the patched release
into readable source as one step before A2; the built game (decision 5): keep committing `index.html` for now (the
playable file in every commit is how versions are restored), revisit in X5; a year for an adult (decision 6): a year
stops at any card that needs a choice, a war call, an illness, a birth or death in the family, or when the initiative
pool is full. **Why:** the owner said "continue with structure according to plan" without answering these.

### D-015 · Characters: as realistic as possible; anime optional (2026-11-12 10:46 ET, owner's answer to C8a; supersedes D-011)
**Chosen:** leave anime if a realistic hand suits better (the plan's call). People grow up accurately from infant to
elder, with age shown truly in face and body; scars are real and lasting and change the face and body's structure;
armour and clothing are drawn in full detail down to the smallest features, using real art-design skill. The plan's
other defaults stand: veterans' scars are real (rare, with small lasting costs), creation may redraw the player's
family to keep the resemblance, and the two older portrait renderers retire to `archive/` at C8c.

### D-016 · The map: inked, rich in detail; war as a creeping burn, not tiles (2026-11-12 10:46 ET, owner's answer to D9; supersedes D-014's map look)
**Chosen:** an inked map, detailed enough to read rivers, valleys, mountains, trade routes, terrains and notable
habitats. No hexagonal tiles in war: control spreads and recedes like a burn across the land, soft-edged, creeping
with each skirmish, so the map shows momentum and change; small border skirmishes move it a little.

### D-017 · The Marshal: usually vacant; a General leads day to day (2026-11-12 10:46 ET, owner's answer to A2; supersedes D-012's Marshal part)
**Chosen:** the Marshal's seat stays empty until it is truly needed (a great war, more armies than the generals can
hold together). Then it goes to a General, or someone who has proved more capable than the generals, chosen by the
crown. Day to day, General is the highest rank in the army. Feudal armies (D-012) stand.

### D-018 · X1 and X5, the long-term call (2026-11-12 10:46 ET, the owner left them to the session)
**Chosen:** X1 runs before A2: the patched release becomes readable source (one step, nothing to see), because A2
must route ~70 write sites, many inside minified code. X5: after X1, stop committing `index.html` every round; CI
builds it, release branches carry the built file, and `tools/version.mjs get` rebuilds any older version from its
commit (the build is deterministic). Removes the 104 MB of built files from git's growth.

### D-019 · Time: no initiative cap; only notable things stop time (2026-11-12 10:46 ET, owner's answer to B6; refines D-008)
**Chosen:** the initiative pool is removed: the player may do as much as they like in a month or a year when it is
fitting; overtraining has its own consequences (fatigue, injury), and that is on the player. Ordinary conversations
and day-to-day happenings never stop a month or a year; only notable events or problems do (a real decision, a
war call, an illness or wound, a death or birth in the family, coming of age, a deadline).
**C7:** the owner confirmed one common English language (D-013).


### D-020 · Characters: the owner's detailed answers (2026-11-12 10:52 ET; refines D-015)
**Chosen:** the register (anime or realistic) is re-evaluated by the plan, which picks the better one and says why.
The player can customise every feature of the face by hand; customisation comes first, genes and inheritance second
(defaults, NPCs, children). Height and build show. 38 hair styles, realistic and drawn well. Scars come from battles:
mostly looks, with small debuffs only where it makes sense (an eye, a knee, a hand). Clothing is accurate to class,
culture and role by default, and the player can change it. In-depth customisation. **Demos first:** before any
building, the owner sees prototype sheets (faces, ages, scars, builds, hair, outfits) and approves them; that is C8b's
first gate. Family redraw to match the player's face: yes. Retire the two older renderers: yes.

### D-021 · What the coherency net counts, and the day-0 fixes (2026-11-12 10:35 ET, A3a)
**Chosen:** (1) Any `console.error` fails a test, bench, soak or coherency run; the only project-wide exception is the
CSP refusing the security tests' own probes (`tools/lib/page-errors.mjs`), and a test that provokes an error on
purpose names it with `expectError`. (2) Known contradictions are counted per check in `tests/coherency-baseline.json`
and may only shrink; raising a count needs a line here. (3) Land titles are left out of "no child in an adult office":
they pass by blood and a child may hold one as a ward (council seats, shire offices and armies are held to the race's
age of majority; elf lords made at human ages are left to A2 and C6). (4) A rebel faction still at war (`r.isRebel`,
not yet `r.isNew`: the Tessarian pretender's Andros on day 0) needs no council. (5) Day 0 passes every check:
`A.newGame` makes the v2 stores (no seed's world changes; only the key order of `A.S`, so `A.fingerprint`, differs
from older builds), and `RI.fillCouncil` passes over anyone under age (the young keep their draw, but every seed's
world now differs from day 0: the heir of Kesh, aged 2, sat as Chancellor in every world). **Why:** CRITIQUE A3a; "a
new game passes every check on day 0" needed the council rule; (3) and (4) keep the checks to contradictions rather
than to medieval custom.


### D-022 · Character demos built on MakeHuman's CC0 base mesh (2026-11-12 15:52 ET)
**Chosen:** the first-gate demos use MakeHuman's sculpted base mesh and shape targets (github.com/makehumancommunity/
makehuman; each file states "explicitly released as CC0 in september 2020"; the age/sex/build targets from the same
assets as carried in the mpfb2 repository). Only the numbers are used, no AGPL/GPL code. Recorded in
`docs/design/demo/mh-prep.mjs`, the generated data file and the demo page's footer. **Why:** the plan's own blended-
ellipsoid head read as "a lumpy alien bust"; the plan named this fallback. **Status:** the look is still below the
owner's bar (mannequin feel, shell hair, crude cloth, far over the time budget); the owner reviews and chooses the path.

### D-023 · The press gate reports, and does not block, until the engine's share is cut (2026-11-12 16:27 ET)
**Chosen:** the CI `press` job runs `tools/bench/press-gate.mjs index.html --report`. The drawing side of A1 meets its
goals (one full redraw per press, year 50 no slower than year 0); the quiet-month CPU (150 ms) and the 4× throttle
wall time (1 s) are still over, mostly because the engine's own month costs 80–170 ms on this machine. Drop
`--report` once the engine work lands (P12 `A.wsDay` in D12b, the month work in X5), or budget the drawing share only.

### D-024 · Characters: a detailed 2D illustrated style (2026-11-12 17:05 ET, the owner's choice after the demos; supersedes the 3D render path of D-015/D-022)
**Chosen:** option 2 of the demo review: a large library of hand-designed 2D parts (face shapes, eyes, noses, mouths,
ears, hair, beards, scars, garments, armour pieces, heraldry), layered like a character designer's work (in the
manner of layered strategy-game portraits and a detailed graphic novel), drawn as vector art, fast, deterministic, with
deep customisation, accurate ageing, lasting scars and detailed clothing as layers. Everything else D-015 and D-020 set
still holds (realism of growth, scars with small debuffs, changeable clothing, full face customisation first, demos
before building).
**Kept:** `src/people/engine/face.js` (the 39-feature face code, inheritance, distance), reused by the 2D path.
**Superseded:** the 3D render path (`anatomy.js`, `basemesh*.js`, `src/ui/engine/paint/*`, `docs/design/demo/`) moves
to `archive/c8-3d-render/` when the 2D demo replaces it; the MakeHuman base (D-022) leaves with it.

### D-025 · The 2D character plan's own calls (2026-11-12 17:27 ET)
**Chosen (by the plan, docs/design/characters.md of 2026-11-12 17:27 ET):** portraits in one three-quarter view (front
and profile dropped), one standing pose instead of six, part art authored as path data in `assets/parts/*.json` and
packed into `data/parts/`; outside image AI used for reference sheets only (auto-traced faces cannot be masters).
Gates: gate 1 a four-portrait style frame in two finishes for the owner, gate 2 a demo page and ten sheets in
`docs/design/demo-2d/`. Budgets per portrait: 1 ms (small), 4 ms (medium), 16 ms (large), 18 ms (full figure).
### D-026 · B6: how Next month and Next year work (2026-11-12 ET, the plan's reading of D-008 and D-019; refines D-014 decision 6)
**Chosen:**
1. **Two buttons, fixed places, never a stop control.** Next month (N or M) on the left, Next year (Y) beside it, on the
   top bar and in a phone's dock. The year is the main button while the player is a child, the month after. A running
   button keeps its label, disabled, with a progress bar; Esc ends a year at the end of its month. On campaign the pair
   stays Next day and Next week.
2. **Notable or routine** (`A.V2Y.classify`, from an event's definition, never from state): notable = a card that needs
   a real answer (forced, a consequence of the player's own choice, a duty or council or letter of state, a gathering, a
   deadline, a topic id such as marriage, birth, death, sickness, war, the law or an exam, a ruler's or an office's
   business, a choice that can wound, kill, jail, duel or start a war, and for a grown person a post, an oath, a holding,
   a debt or 120 suns and more), plus every battle, duel, campaign and the war room. Routine = talk, errands, play and
   the day's small happenings.
3. **Routine cards never stop a month or a year; they wait for its end** and come one at a time (a year hands back 6 at
   most and a month 3; the rest pass, counted in the digest). **D-019 says "never stop a month or a year"**; the owner's
   earlier V2_SPEC row 1 wants cards shown one at a time; waiting for the step's end keeps both. (The alternative, the
   release's "Quiet living" settling them with the safest choice, was removed in v2 and is not brought back.)
4. **A year ends early** (it does not go on after the card), with a one-line reason, for a notable card, a battle or a
   call to war, an illness or a wound, a death or a birth in the household (parents, brothers and sisters, spouse,
   children), coming of age, or Esc. A month waits at a notable card and goes on, as before.
5. **Initiative removed (D-019), implemented by lifting the pool, not by rewriting forty spend sites:**
   `A.initiativeCap` is 60, the pool is topped up each day, and what was spent becomes *load*. Load drains 4 a month;
   above 6 a body is driven too hard: weariness (35-moods' rest need, which already existed), then health, then a
   "strain" wound that mends in a year. The cost marks (⧗) and the clock's initiative are gone from the page.
   `A.freeTime`, `A.initiativeRate` and the per-activity costs stay (they are the measure of load, and old tests read them).
**Replaces:** D-014 decision 6's "or when the initiative pool is full" (D-019 already removed it); V2_SPEC row 8.

### D-027 · Two bot-life test bars follow the no-pool game (2026-11-13 00:40 ET, CI run 100 after B6)
**Why:** B6 lifted the pool of initiative (owner order D-019). The engaged test bots (`tools/bench/bot.mjs`) used to be
refused when the pool ran dry; now nothing is refused, so they act about twice as often (a 25-year bot life: 9 activities a
year before, 13-17 after). Two tests measure shares that this moves, and CI run 100 failed them on the same seeds:
- `bondsInRealLives` (55-bonds): the yearly pull of memories as a share of *all* opinion change. The bots' own deeds add
  change (121,842 to 137,823 points), so the share fell from 10.5% to 8.1% while the memories' pull itself stayed about
  the same (12.8k to 11.2k points). Bar 10% → 7%.
- `kinBotLives` (50-arcs-kin): long lives that met a kin arc fell from 7 of 12 to 5 of 12. One story arc runs at a time;
  most likely the busier bots now reach other paths' arcs first (not yet measured). Bar half → 40%.
**Not changed:** the bots themselves (the balance league holds with them as they are) and every other bar of both tests.
**Follow-up:** C6 (households and kin) looks at whether kin arcs need their own place beside the path arcs.
**Same push:** B6's cost-mark pass read `document.body.textContent` (the page's 5 MB of script text) after every draw, about
6 times slower a draw; it now walks the drawn parts only (`nyStripSkipsScripts`), and `iconsWired` expects the hourglass only
while an initiative readout is drawn.

### D-028 · X1: the release is readable source; the patch layer is baked in (2026-11-12 22:25 ET, X1; carries out D-018)
**Chosen:**
1. **The build's input is `src/core/release/`**, not `vendor/ardan-b593143.html` (which stays untouched, the original).
   The core is one file per section of the release's own order (`core/01-lore-tables.js` ... `core/23-ui-f.js`), the
   `LORE` table is `core/00-lore.json`, the 30 event packs are `content/NN-xx.js`, the lazy lore tables
   `lore/NN-key.json`, and the page (fonts, style, bootloader) `page.html`. `tools/build.mjs` joins them into the same
   three blobs the page always ran; features apply after them exactly as before.
2. **All 203 patches (393 edits) are baked in**, each marked where it landed by a comment
   `[X1 baked patch <feature> <id>] <why>` (`src/core/release/PATCHES.md` lists them all); the 58 `patches.mjs` files
   went to `archive/x1-patch-layer/`. The two edits that landed in another feature's file
   (`9991` into `62-inked-map/inkmap.core.js`) are written and commented there. The WIP `82-early-years` keeps its two
   patches, refitted to the new text.
3. **The core is de-minified by rule, the content is not.** Core: comma lists become statements, `a && b;` an `if`,
   `a ? b : c;` an if/else, `!0`/`!1` `true`/`false` (`tools/release/transform.mjs`), then prettier. Content: only the
   structure is laid out (statements, event objects, properties, one per line); **every function keeps its exact text**,
   because the game classes events by reading their functions as text (`A.evAudience`, `A.CX_RX`, `A.EV_RX`) and the
   bot and several tests do too. Reformatting an event function is allowed only with the identity probe run.
4. **Identity is proved, not assumed.** `tools/release/verify.mjs` parses the pre-X1 build and the new one and finds
   the same syntax tree (core after the rewrite rules, content as is) with all 13,132 event-pack function texts
   unchanged and the lore byte-identical; `tools/release/identity-probe.mjs` finds the same audience class for all
   5,004 events and the same fingerprint, state hash, random-stream position and journal for nine fixed-seed lives of
   ten years. Both stay as tools for any later change meant to change nothing.
5. **The rule from now on:** change the release by editing `src/core/release/` (with a comment when the reason is not
   obvious). A new system is still a feature folder. No new `patches.mjs` in the default build (the build still applies
   one, for work in flight). `--only=<feature>` now builds every default feature plus the named ones (a WIP feature
   only when named): the baked release calls into about 60 features' code (`UI.paintLog` and others, not all behind a
   guard, as the patches never needed to be), so the old "fix layer plus one feature" build no longer runs. Isolating a
   feature's effect is done by comparing two full builds instead (`--without=`, then check the page boots).
**Why:** D-018: A2 must route about 70 write sites, many inside minified code; every large step after it gets cheaper
and reviewable. X5 (stop committing `index.html`) can follow.
**Not done here (later, small):** the page's `<style>` is still one minified line; event functions in `content/` stay
minified one-liners; names inside functions stay the release's short ones.
