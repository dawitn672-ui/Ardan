# Decisions

One short record per important design or engineering choice: what was chosen, what else was considered, and why.
Read before changing anything these touch. To reverse one, add a new record that says so; never edit an old one.

### D-001 · Repo layout: features live with their system (2026-11-12, round 2 step 0)
**Chosen:** every feature folder moved from `features/NN-name/` to `src/<system>/NN-name/` (11 systems: core, map,
world, people, family, nobility, diplomacy, war, economy, events, ui). Features still apply in the order of their
folder names, sorted across all systems exactly as before, so the build is unchanged (verified: the new blobs differ
from the old only in comments). Every tool finds features through `tools/lib/features.mjs`, never by path.
**Considered:** keeping `features/` and adding `src/` only for new code (no navigation gain); renumbering features
per system (would change patch order and break 196 patches that depend on it).
**Why:** the owner asked for a layout split by system; ordering by name keeps the 196 order-dependent patches valid.

### D-002 · Events stay as code, next to their system (2026-11-12)
**Chosen:** event packs (`*.events.js`) stay in their feature folders. `data/` holds only content that is pure data
(cultures and names, military branches, items), loaded as `A.DATA[...]` by the build.
**Considered:** moving all events to `data/events/` as JSON.
**Why:** an event holds functions (`cond`, `setup`, sometimes `text`, `fx`, check functions), and `A.evAudience` /
`A.CX_RX` classify events by reading those functions' source. JSON would lose them; moving the `.js` files away from
the feature that owns their flags and patches would split one unit of change across two places.

### D-003 · The v2 engine modules live in their systems (2026-11-12)
**Chosen:** `src/v2/*.js` moved to `src/<system>/engine/` (body, races, odds, renown in people; kin, succession in
family; war, orders in war; ...), entry `src/core/engine/index.js`. The bundle is byte-identical apart from its path
comments. The kit's standalone demo UI went to `archive/v2-kit-demo-ui/` (never part of the game).
**Why:** split by system, as asked; the engine's unit tests (`tests/v2/`) still pass (29 of 29).

### D-004 · Measurement harnesses are tools (2026-11-12)
**Chosen:** `bench/` moved to `tools/bench/`, its reports to `tools/bench/reports/`.
**Why:** the owner's layout puts build, playtest and check scripts under `tools/`.

### D-005 · Working branch and milestones (2026-11-12)
**Chosen:** round 2 works on `v2-integration`, so PR #2 runs CI on every push. Milestones get a `release/<name>`
branch (beta.1 is `release/v2.0.0-beta.1`) as well as a row in `docs/VERSIONS.md`.
**Considered:** a new branch and pull request for round 2; git tags.
**Why:** the session's git proxy refuses tag pushes (tried again on Nov 12: the push is cut off), and a new PR would
need its own CI setup; release branches can be pushed and restored like tags.

### D-006 · Tests use the container's Playwright (2026-11-12)
**Chosen:** `tests/run.mjs` falls back to `/opt/node-tools/node_modules/playwright` when `node_modules/playwright`
is missing; in a fresh container delete the pinned copy after `npm ci`.
**Why:** the pinned Playwright 1.56.1 wants a Chromium build the container does not have; CI installs its own.

### D-007 · Descriptions open on click (2026-11-12, owner's round 2 order B4)
**Chosen:** hover pop-ups are removed; a button or an info icon opens a description. This replaces V2_SPEC's older
rule "never hide a description behind a click".
**Why:** the owner's order. To be done in step B4; recorded now so nobody re-adds hover tooltips meanwhile.

### D-008 · Time moves by Next month or Next year (2026-11-12, owner's order)
**Chosen:** two buttons, Next month and Next year. A year runs month by month underneath and stops early when
something needs the player (a real decision, an illness, an exam, a call to war); quiet months pass as feed lines.
Next year is the main button in childhood; an adult chooses. Next day and Next week stay for campaigns.
**Replaces:** V2_SPEC complaint 8's "only Next month" and the game-ux-playtest-loop rule "one button moves time".
**Why:** the owner: "There's no need to go month by month as a child without a reason and there are times simming a
whole year is too much as an adult." To be built as B6 after the owner reviews the critique; the spec and the skill
are updated when it is built.

### D-009 · Which model does which part (2026-11-12, owner's plan)
**Chosen:** the owner's table, for every agent and every session that works on round 2:

| Part | Model | Effort |
|---|---|---|
| Step 0: restructure, history files | Opus 5.5 | High |
| Step 1: harsh critique and work order | Fable (5.2 or the newest Fable available) | Max |
| A1: lag | Opus 5.5 | High |
| A2–A3: rank and title consistency, coherency checks | Opus 5.5 | High |
| B4–B5: click-to-open descriptions, declutter | Sonnet 5.5 | High |
| B6: Next month or Next year (added Nov 12; not in the owner's table: treated like B4–B5) | Sonnet 5.5 | High |
| C6: relationships (households, servants, guards) | Opus 5.5 | High |
| C7: names and cultures | Sonnet 5.5 | High |
| C8: character design | Fable to plan, then Opus 5.5 to build | High |
| D9: map detail | Opus 5.5 | High |
| D10: war only when deployed | Sonnet 5.5 | High |
| D11: military branches | Opus 5.5 | High |
| D12: war and command depth | Fable to design, then Opus 5.5 to build | High |
| Playtester agents | Sonnet 5.5 | Default |

**How:** work is delegated to agents with that model and effort; the orchestrating session integrates, tests and
records. The first critique round of Nov 12 ran on the session's own model (Opus) before this plan arrived: its
reports are kept as evidence, and Fable at max effort writes the critique and the work order from them and its own play.
